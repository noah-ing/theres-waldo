# üîç There's Waldo: Modern Vision Transformer for Finding Waldo

A state-of-the-art implementation for solving "Where's Waldo?" puzzles using JAX and Vision Transformers. This project demonstrates modern deep learning practices and efficient implementation using JAX's automatic differentiation and compilation capabilities.

## üöÄ Project Status (January 2025)

### Completed Upgrades
- Modernized codebase with JAX/Flax implementation
- Added Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone with DETR-style detection
- Implemented modern training practices (Focal Loss, GIoU Loss)
- Added configuration management with Hydra
- Set up experiment tracking with Weights & Biases
- Added comprehensive data augmentation pipeline

### Current Setup
- Virtual environment created and activated
- Core dependencies installed:
  - JAX/Flax ecosystem
  - TensorFlow for data handling
  - OpenCV and Pillow for image processing
  - Wandb for experiment tracking
  - Hydra for configuration
  - Pandas for data management

### Next Steps Needed
1. Fix Hydra configuration path issue
2. Complete model training with the new architecture
3. Convert existing TensorFlow model weights (optional)
4. Test and validate the new implementation

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/noah-ing/theres-waldo.git
cd theres-waldo

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/MacOS

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## üìä Model Architecture

The model uses a Vision Transformer backbone with modern improvements:
- Pre-norm transformer blocks for stable training
- Learnable class token for global feature aggregation
- Sinusoidal positional embeddings
- DETR-style detection head for accurate localization

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Model

### Current TensorFlow Model (Legacy)
The original TensorFlow implementation is temporarily unavailable due to compatibility issues with TensorFlow 2.x.

### New JAX Implementation (In Progress)
Training pipeline is set up but requires configuration fixes. Stay tuned for updates.

## üìà Dataset

The project uses a curated dataset of Where's Waldo images with:
- 30+ annotated images
- Precise bounding box coordinates
- Various scene complexities
- Multiple image resolutions

## üìã Next Steps (For New Chat)

Copy the following prompt for the next chat session:

```
I have a Where's Waldo detector project that's being upgraded to use JAX/Flax with Vision Transformers. Current status:

1. Directory structure:
   - src/waldo_finder/: Main package with modernized implementation
   - config/: Hydra configuration files
   - images/: Training images
   - annotations/: Bounding box annotations
   - trained_model/: Original TensorFlow model (needs updating)

2. Environment:
   - Virtual environment created and activated
   - Core dependencies installed (JAX, Flax, TensorFlow, etc.)
   - Wandb login completed

3. Current Issue:
   Hydra configuration error: "Primary config directory not found"
   Error message suggests checking if 'src/config' exists and is readable

4. Next Task:
   Fix the configuration directory issue and proceed with training the new JAX-based model.

Can you help resolve the configuration issue and guide me through training the model?
```

This will provide the next chat session with clear context and a focused task to continue the development.
